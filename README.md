A universal two-zone model for black hole accretion flows: statistical evidence from M87* and Sgr A*
We present a universal two-zone model for the innermost accretion flow and jet base of supermassive black holes,
validated using the two best-studied objects: M87* and Sgr A*. The model consists of a compact field-enhancement
core at ∼ 2 gravitational radii (rg) and an extended sheath reaching ∼ 12rg. Through Bayesian model comparison
with multi-frequency spectral data spanning 108–1012 Hz, we demonstrate overwhelming statistical evidence for this
two-zone structure, with Bayes factors of 1010 for M87* and 109
for Sgr A* against simpler models. Remarkably,
all five dimensionless parameters—core amplification factor (Acore ≈ 5), core radius (rcore ≈ 2.1rg), sheath extent
(Rshell ≈ 12rg), density contrast (nshell/ncore ≈ 0.02), and particle energy index (pshell ≈ 2.7)—are consistent within
uncertainties for both objects, despite their mass difference of three orders of magnitude and different accretion
regimes. This universality suggests a common physical structure in black hole accretion and jet launching across
vastly different mass scales, providing new constraints for GRMHD simulations and theories of jet formation.
